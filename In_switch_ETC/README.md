## Organization of the folder  
There are two folders:  
<!-- - _Data_ : information on how to access the data  -->
- _Switch_ : the P4 code for the Tofino switch, the M/A table entries, and the runtime controller code.
- _Offline_ : the jupyter notebooks for training the machine learning models and for offline evaluation, and the scripts for generating the M/A table entries from trained models.

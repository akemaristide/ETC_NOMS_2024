To run the code:
- check the code and change the forwarding port 260 to the right one in your setup
- compile the P4 code
    - we used the Intel SDE version 9.7.0
- load the code onto the switch using _bf_switchd_
- load the table entries in the _table_entries.py_ file using _bfrt_python_
    - this also configures and brings up ports 1, 5 and 9 (56, 260, 292) which we use.
    - modify them according to your setup.
- run the _controller_digest_noms.py_ script to enable the controller to collect packet digests with classification results, clean registers after flows are classified, and update the flow table. 
    - give your output csv file as an argument to this script when running it.
- send packets from the pcap files through the switch using tcpreplay
    - the current configuration has a filter table in the P4 program that will filter only the flows belonging to the test data for classification in order to easily compare them with the offline results.
- use the function at the end of the _NIMS2023_Data_Analysis.ipynb_ notebook to analyze the csv obtained at the controller at the end of the experiment.
